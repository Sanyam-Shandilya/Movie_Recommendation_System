# Movie_Recommendation_System
This is my movie recommendation system based on the content based systems. The website is a basic streamlit website used for visualizing the results and proper working as well. This projct is based on the tmdb_5000 movies dataset so it will not contain all the movies as expected. The tf-idf-vectorizer is used for the vectorization process, porterstemmer for stemming and cosine similarity for angular distance.
## Techonologies used are:-
1. Streamlit
2. Pandas
3. NLTK
4. Ast
5. Pickle
6. Sklearn
